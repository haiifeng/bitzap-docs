`admin fee`

Admin fee is revenue source for veCRV. They determine how much of the fee charged is redistributed to veCRV holders. E.g. if a pool has a admin fee of 50%, half of the fees charged within the pools are distributed, the other half is going to the liquidity providers. crvUSD has a admin fee of 100%, meaning all interest rate fees are going to veCRV.
